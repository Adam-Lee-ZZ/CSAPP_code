# CSAPP Learning note

## Introduction

This is the learning note of the *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*, which is also called CSAPP. I first knew about this book from the website CSDIY[^1], and ended up finding it to be a terrific textbook for learning almost everything about computer systems.

This learning note includes my answers to some of the homework excersise in the book, and my personal solutions to the Labs of the course.[^2]

## Methology

Many professional programmers including the author of CSDIY advise the learner to watch the course recording by CMU, which can be easily found on YouTube. However, in some respects, it does not seem to be the best method for me.

Firstly, the book itself offers more detailed information which may be obmitted during the class, which really fit those who want a more systematic view of the computer system. Besides, as the videos were recorded in 2015, they may be a little bit old. As a result, I prefer reading the book directly.

It may be a sad news that CSAPP owns a reputation of being so difficult to read. Fortunately, nowadays, we have AI. My choice is to discuss concepts I am unsure about with ChatGPT. It seems to be a good way to learn new things. After finishing the main part of the book, I may organize the answers of the GPT and my personal insights into detailed notes, and attach them below.
